Data is pulled using get_recruit_data.py and get_roster_data.py from the CFBD api:
https://collegefootballdata.com/

In order to run the scripts, you will need an API key. An API key can be obtained from the
above linked site.

Your API key should be stored in a .env file as:
CFBD_API_KEY=[your key]

An example .env file is included in the repo.
